<h5>According to Open Ottawa, the official database of the City of Ottawa, there were 988 cases of bike thefts that happened in 2020. The primary purpose of this website is to demonstrate the situation of bike thefts around Ottawa in 2020 and to promote situational awareness among bikers who use their bikes as their primary method of commuting.</h5>
<h5>Bike thefts can be a real issue in the city of Ottawa, especially Downtown where bikes are stolen at almost every street corner! To help people prevent their bike from getting stolen and know where the safer spots to leave it unattended are, we have provided data that shows where and when bike thefts most often occur. We indicate which are the top 5 most risky neighborhoods for bikes. Each of those neighborhoods have their own distinct color on the map along with bar charts and histograms that add more information about them. Now, youâ€™ll be able to ride your bike around Ottawa with much less stress for the safety of your bike! </h5>
<iframe id="myMaps" src="https://www.google.com/maps/d/embed?mid=1N9aKORIPn-6jwPxjn3kUVnOuQpMN-CAG&ehbc=2E312F" width="100%" height="600"></iframe> </br>

  <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=1N9aKORIPn-6jwPxjn3kUVnOuQpMN-CAG&usp=sharing">The link to the map</a>
  <h5>By browsing the map, you will get to know the top 5 neighbourhoods where most bike thefts happened in 2020. If the ALL button is selected all bike thefts from 2020 and the location of it. Only the top 5 are highlighted but all points are shown.</h5>
  <iframe id="mytime" src="https://public.tableau.com/views/AllBikeThefts/Sheet1?::showVizHome=no&:embed=true" height="500px" width="100%"></iframe>
  <h5>Above is another bar graph that shows the time of the bike thefts in collective times of 4 hours. Such as 12am to 4am, 4am to 8am, 8am to 12pm, 12pm to 4pm, 4pm to 8pm, and 8pm to 12am.</h5>

  <h5>Below we have included the drafts which give an idea of the process we went through before finalizing our visualizations.</h5>
  <img src="VizPhoneapp1.png">
  <img src="VizPhoneapp2.png">
  <h5>These are drafts of what would have been a phone application that funtions a bit like a GPS. The user would be able to see what their location is and find circles that represent the locations of bike thefts. The colour saturation of a circle would represent the number of bikes stolen at a specific place. Bright red circles would represent a higher number of bike thefts than pink ones.
  <img src="VizTrafficsign.png">
  <h5>This draft is one that shows the location of thefts that occured near different types of traffic signs in Ottawa. The user is able to filter through different types of traffic signs. Knowing the areas in which many bikes stored near specific traffic signs were stolen will help the user know to avoid storing their bike near certain signs depending on their location. This idea ended up being used in the final version in the form of a bar chart that shows the traffic signs associated with bike thefts.</h5>
  <img src="VizThefttypes.png">
  <h5>This draft shows a map that functions a lot like the previous one shown. The user is able to filter the data they want to see. Instead of being about traffic signs, this one is about different types of bike thefts. Additionally, it includes a pie chart and a bar chart that both show which bike theft types occur more frequently. The idea of using smaller visualizations that add more information to the map would be used to create the final product.</h5>
  <img src="VizCirclearea.png">
  <h5>This draft uses circles that represent the number of bike thefts per neighbourhood. The more bike thefts there are in a neighbourhood, the larger the circle representing it will be. This visualization also included a small bar chart that includes the average time of thefts for each neighbourhood. The idea of showing the average theft times would be included in the final version.</h5>
  <img src="VizRefinedtraffic.png">
  <h5>This is a refined version of the third draft shown.</h5>
  <img src="VizPrefinal.png">
  <h5>This draft looks the most like the final version. Some changes include the fact that the donut chart shown was turned into a bar chart that displays the information more clearly. In addition, the bar chart that shows the time of thefts was later turned into a hisogram. Another change was that instead of using general areas of Ottawa such as East, West and Center, we ended up using the neighbourhoods with the most bike thefts.</h5>
